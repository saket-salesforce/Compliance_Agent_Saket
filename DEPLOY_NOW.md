## Quickest Way - Netlify Drop (Recommended)

### Steps:

1. **Open your browser** and go to:
   ```

   ```

2. **Drag & Drop**: Drag the entire `deploy` folder onto the page
   - Just wait 30 seconds...
   - You'll see: "Site deployed successfully!" ✅

3. **Get your URL**: You'll see something like:
   ```
   https://amazing-dashboard-123.netlify.app
   ```

4. **Share the link**: 
   - Main dashboard: `https://your-site.netlify.app/demo.html`
   - Put this link in your document/email/Slack!

**That's it! No signup needed, completely free, works forever.**

## Alternative: GitHub Pages (For Permanent Professional Link)

If you want a GitHub URL (more professional), here's a quick script:

```bash
cd deploy
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Compliance Dashboard"
# Then push to GitHub and enable Pages (see DEPLOY.md for details)
```

## Your Links Structure After Deployment:

Once deployed, people can access:
- 🏠 **Home**: `/demo.html`
- 📊 **Deal Desk**: `/deal_desk.html`
- ✅ **Compliance**: `/compliance_tab.html`
- 🔍 **Deal Details**: `/deal_detail.html?deal=390-3452`
